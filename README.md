# Dhammer

Dhammer is a stress-tester for DHCP servers.  It currently only supports DHCPv4, but it was created with the strong intention of including DHCPv6 in the very near future.

**Please, read the full disclaimer at the bottom of this document**.

**This tool is meant for testing YOUR OWN networks and servers**.  I wrote this with the intention of using it to stress-test a DHCP framework I have in development and to aid in the addition of DHCPv6 features to the framework.  Thus, Dhammer is meant to be used as a diagnostic tool, and it should not be used for malicious activity.

Dhammer can act as a "local" DHCP client broadcasting packets, or it can simulate a DHCP relay, allowing you to test DHCP servers outside of your local network and also to avoid any potential broadcast-storm safeguards your router might have.

It's also possible to have dhammer bind any assigned IPs to the loopback and handle ARP requests, including responding to ARPs with a generated MAC address instead of the actual MAC of the interface sending the original DHCP requests.

## Getting Started

Just download, compile, and run.

### Installing

```
go get -u github.com/ipchama/dhammer
```
### Building
```
go build .
```
## Examples
#### Broadcast on the local network 
```
sudo ./dhammer dhcpv4 --interface wlan1 --mac-count 10000 --rps 100 --maxlife 0
```
#### Target a specific server via DHCP relay
```
sudo ./dhammer dhcpv4 --interface wlan1 --mac-count 10000 --gateway-mac "48:f8:b6:f7:30:28" --rps 1000 --maxlife 0 --relay-target-server-ip 192.168.1.1 --relay-source-ip 192.168.1.143
```
To use the relay, particularly if you'll be attempting to test a server across the WAN, you'll need the MAC of your gateway.  However, if you omit the `--gateway-mac` option, dhammer will attempt to find your default route and ARP for the MAC address. 

Dhammer uses very raw sockets to do its job, so `CAP_NET_ADMIN` (for binding) and `CAP_NET_RAW` are needed at the very least.  I.e., just `sudo` and get moving.

Stats are now accessible via API calls with JSON responses.  An example python script to interact with them is included in the repo.
